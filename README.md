#User Story
As a user I want a website where I can search for movies and their soundtracks, add those movies to a watchlist, as well as journal reviews after theyve been watched. Using the OMDB and YouTube APIs, there will be the option to search for the movies along with their soundtrack.

GIVEN a dashboard of an array of movies
I can then choose a movie and pull the soundtrack/trailer from YouTube
I can save both the movie and soundtrack/trailer to my history.
WHEN the movie name/link is added to my history
THEN I can add comments or emojis to it.
WHEN the soundtrack/trailer is added to my hitory
THEN I can add comments or emojis to it.
