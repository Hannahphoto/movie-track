# User Story
As a user I want a website where I can search for movies and their soundtracks, add those movies to a watchlist. Using the OMDB and Spotify APIs, there will be the option to search for the movies along with their soundtrack linking to the Spotify App.

GIVEN a search input,
I can then searchfor a movie and pull the soundtrack from Spotify.
I can save both the movie and soundtrack to my Watchlist.
WHEN the movie & link is added to my history,
THEN I can have a list of movies i want to watch later.
WHEN the soundtrack is added to my hitory
THEN I can link to the soundtrack in Spotify. 


# Notes
Hannah and Beth forgot to pull before doing the pull request and merging. We eventually figured it out with help. 
Our HTML was a mess. Great learning experience for the first time, we had two inputs and buttons from Beth and Hannah testing their API's on thier end. With help, we got our main branch organized, and functioning with both API's.  
Seem to be on track with in class work and project meeting presentations on Thursday.
